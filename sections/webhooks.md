Webhooks
=========

Webhooks allow you to receive notifications at an end-point of your choice for a myriad of events in Image Relay.
Get notified when a file is uploaded, a new user is added, a folder is deleted, etc.

When there is a problem with a webhook, Image Relay will send an email to the user that created the webhook.
The API also supports optionally adding additional notification emails to the webhook if you wish to
alert other email addresses if issues arise.


Get Webhooks
-----------

* `GET /webhooks.json` returns a list of all of your webhooks
* `GET /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` returns details about the specified webhook.

```json
[
  {
    "user_id":"<user_id>",
    "resource":"<resource1>",
    "action":"<supported_action1>",
    "url":"<url_posting_to1>",
    "created_at":"created",
    "state": "normal",
    "notification_emails": ["<comma separated list of emails>"]
  },
  {
    "user_id":"<user_id>",
    "resource":"<resource2>",
    "action":"<supported_action2>",
    "url":"<url_posting_to2>",
    "created_at":"created",
    "state": "normal",
    "notification_emails": ["<comma separated list of emails>"]
  }
]
```

Create Webhook
--------------

Image Relay webhooks all include a `resource` and an `action`. Supported resources and their actions can be viewed [below](https://github.com/imagerelay/api/blob/master/sections/webhooks.md#supported-webhooks)

* `POST /webhooks.json` will create a new webhook.

After a webhooks has been created, if an event occurs that is specified in the webhook, Image Relay will POST the event details back to you at the `url` specified in the webhook.

```json
{
  "resource": "<resource>",
  "action": "<supported_action>",
  "url": "<url_to_post_to>",
  "notification_emails": ["<comma separated list of emails>"]
}
```

This will return `201 Created`, if successful.

Update Webhook
--------------

* `PUT /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` will update the specified webhook's state.


Valid `state` values are:
* `normal`: normal functionality.
* `paused`: user-initiated paused state, webhook will not be invoked
* `error`: Image Relay encountered too many HTTP errors when invoking the webhook callback URL, callbacks have been temporarily suspended until the next day when it will be auto-resumed.

```json
{
	"state":"<new_state>"
}
```

Will return `200 OK` and a representation of the webhook.
```json
{
  "resource": "<resource>",
  "action": "<supported_action>",
  "url": "<url_to_post_to>",
  "state": "paused",
  "notification_emails": "<comma separated list of emails>"
}
```

Delete Webhook
--------------

* `DELETE /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` will delete the specified webhook.

This will return `204 No Content` if successful.

Supported Webhooks
------------------

* `GET /webhooks/supported.json` returns a list of webhooks that Image Relay currently supports, these include the resource
and action required to create the hook. Authentication is not required for this call. Check it out here: [https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/webhooks/supported.json](https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/webhooks/supported.json)

This will return `200 Ok`

```json
[
  {
    "resource": "file",
    "supported_actions": [
      "created",
      "expiration_date_set",
      "expiration_date_removed",
      "file_type_changed",
      "name_changed",
      "recovered",
      "added_to_folder",
      "removed_from_folder",
      "keywords_updated",
      "updated_file",
      "processed",
      "deleted"
    ]
  },
  {
    "resource": "folder",
    "supported_actions": [
      "created",
      "renamed",
      "moved",
      "deleted",
      "recovered",
      "shared"
    ]
  },
  {
    "resource": "user",
    "supported_actions": [
      "created",
      "modified",
      "destroyed"
    ]
  }
]
```

Details about our currently supported list of resources and actions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Response

All Webhook POSTs will contain an `event` section which then has a `resource`, `action`, `resource_id`, `actor_id`, and potentially `recipient_id`. `resource` is the type of resource triggering the event (e.g. file, folder...), `action` is the type of action that occurred (e.g. created, updated...), `resource_id` is the unique ID in Image Relay for the resource that triggered this event. `actor_id` is the unique ID of the user who caused the event to happen (i.e. uploaded the file,
created the folder), and `recipient_id` is optionally present when necessary. For instance, in the case of a "File added to
Folder" triggered, `recipient_id` would be the unique folder ID of the folder to which the file was added. The `event` section will always be present for all webhook calls.

A `data` section is also included containing data specific to the resource being triggered. For a File, for instance, it will contain details
about the file such as name, ID, parent folder, etc.
